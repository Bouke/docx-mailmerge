Performs a Mail Merge on Office Open XML (docx) files. Can be used on any
system without having to install Microsoft Office Word. Supports Python 2.7,
3.3 and up.

Installation
============

Installation with ``pip``:
::

    $ pip install docx-mailmerge


Usage
=====

Open the file.
::

    from mailmerge import MailMerge
    with MailMerge('input.docx') as document:
        ...


List all merge fields.
::

    print document.get_merge_fields()


Merge fields, supplied as kwargs.
::

    document.merge(field1='docx Mail Merge',
                   field2='Can be used for merging docx documents')

Merge table rows. In your template, add a MergeField to the row you would like
to designate as template. Supply the name of this MergeField as ``anchor``
parameter. The second parameter contains the rows with key-value pairs for
the MergeField replacements.
::

    document.merge_rows('col1',
                        [{'col1': 'Row 1, Column 1', 'col2': 'Row 1 Column 1'},
                         {'col1': 'Row 2, Column 1', 'col2': 'Row 2 Column 1'},
                         {'col1': 'Row 3, Column 1', 'col2': 'Row 3 Column 1'}])


Starting in version 0.2.0 you can also combine these two separate calls into a
single call to `merge`.
::

    document.merge(field1='docx Mail Merge',
                   col1=[
                       {'col1': 'A'},
                       {'col1': 'B'},
                   ])


Starting in version 0.2.0 there's also the feature for template merging.
This creates a copy of the template for each item in the list, does a merge,
and separates them by page or section breaks (see function documentation).

When using this feature, make sure you don't use comments, footnotes, 
bookmarks, etc. This is because these elements have an id attribute, which
must be unique. This library does not handle this, resulting in invalid
documents.
::

    document.merge_templates([
        {'field1': "Foo", 'field2: "Copy #1"},
        {'field1': "Bar", 'field2: "Copy #2"},
    ], separator='page_break')


Write document to file. This should be a new file, as ``ZipFile`` cannot modify
existing zip files.
::

    document.write('output.docx')

Unit tests
----------

In order to make sure that the library performs the way it was designed, unit
tests are used. When providing new features, or fixing bugs, there should be a
unit test that demonstrates it. Run the test suite::

    python -m unittest discover
